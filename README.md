## Overview and Origin

### What are Robo-Advisors?

Robo-advisor is a platform that provides algorithm based financial tools that are fully automated without human input. They collect information through a survery about risk level and financial goals to recommend and automatically invest assets in a diversified portfolio. (1)

Robo-advisors burst onto the scene during the 2008 financial crisis as a way to invest and save with low fees and zero starting balances with the goal of passive long term investing relying on a basket of ETF's to achieve a highly diversified portfolios. (2)


### Subject of Case Study

Wealthfront is one of the more popular stand-alone Robo-Advisors on the market. It was incorporated in 2008 by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll. It was started by Dan Carroll when he was trying to rework his parents portfolios after the financial crisis of 2008 had left them in a bind. He realized that his parents were not getting the same attention from their investment advisor due to their small portfolio (in terms of assets). Meanwhile, as Andy was teaching, his students kept asking him for advice on investments and where to get started. Andy could not give them an answer because traditional avenues had high barriers to enter for broke college students. Andy came across the prototype that Dan had circulated and reached out to him to start the partnership. (3)

Currently, Wealthfront is a privately held company that has had 5 rounds of funding for a total of 204.5 million. (4)

|Series   |Funds       |

|Series a |7.5 million |
|Series b |20 million  |
|Series c |35 million  |

**Note**:

**Notes**:
- *Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)* is a collection of stocks or bonds in a single fund. So an ETF of S&P 500 (VOO) consists of one fund that includes stocks of companies listed on the S&P 500 index (like Apple, Amazon, Visa)(=instant diversification) (9)
- *Stock level tax loss harvesting* is selling individual stocks to generate tax savings. This is done for all portfolios greater than $100000. Wealthfront replaces US Stocks broad market ETF (Vanguard's Total Stock Market ETF) with up to 100 of the largest capitalization US stocks and a combination of the Vanguard Extended Market ETF (VFX) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). It replaces more with higher levels as assets under management. (10)
- *Risk Parity* - Fund offered by wealthfront to investors with over $100K invested, that aims to generate a higher return for a given amount of portfolio risk. (11)
- *Smart Beta* - available to investors with more than $500K invested. Aims to increase expected returns by weighting the securities in the portfolio more intelligently. It analyzes factors such as value, momentum, dividend yield, maket beta and volatility in addition to the traditional market capitalization factor to weigh the securities. (12)

### Tech at work

Wealthfront uses the following programs for its operations (13):

|Category| Products|
|--------|---------|
|Apps and Data| JS, React, Java, Amazon CloudFront, Google Cloud Platform, C++, Kotlin, D3.js |
|Utilities |Google Analytics, Twilio SendGrid |
|DevOps |CMake |
|Business Tools |G Suite, Zendesk |

It also uses the modern potfolio theory to build the portfolios it recommends to its clients.

**Note**:

*Modern Portfolio Theory* is a methodology that aims to identify a portfolio with the highest expected return for a given level of risk. This is achieved through diversification. Thus, most robo-advisor portfolios are a basket of ETF's. (14)
