Robo-advisors burst onto the scene during the 2008 financial crisis as a way to invest and save with low fees and zero starting balances with the goal of passive long term investing relying on a basket of ETF's to achieve a highly diversified portfolios. (2)

### Subject of Case Study

Wealthfront is one of the more popular stand-alone Robo-Advisors on the market. It was incorporated in 2008 by Andy Rachleff and Dan Carroll. It was started by Dan Carroll when he was trying to rework his parents portfolios after the financial crisis of 2008 had left them in a bind. He realized that his parents were not getting the same attention from their investment advisor due to their small portfolio (in terms of assets). Meanwhile, as Andy was teaching, his students kept asking him for advice on investments and where to get started. Andy could not give them an answer because traditional avenues had high barriers to enter for broke college students. Andy came across the prototype that Dan had circulated and reached out to him to start the partnership. (3)
